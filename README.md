# Overview

This game is designed to be a fun platformer where the player is trying to navigate a constantly moving landscape. The player tries to get as far as he can and can measure himself with the distance readout in the bottom corner. However if the player falls too low then the game ends and they are elminiated.

The purpose of this software was to familiarize myself with some of the mechanics in the arcade library.
